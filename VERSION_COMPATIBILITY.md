# Version Compatibility Guide

## Supported Minecraft Versions

This mod is built to support **all Minecraft 1.21.x versions**:
- ✅ Minecraft 1.21
- ✅ Minecraft 1.21.1
- ✅ Minecraft 1.21.2
- ✅ Minecraft 1.21.3
- ✅ Minecraft 1.21.4
- ✅ Future 1.21.x releases

## How Version Compatibility Works

The mod uses the `~1.21` version constraint in `fabric.mod.json`, which means:
- The `~` (tilde) operator matches any version in the 1.21.x series
- It will work with any Minecraft version from 1.21.0 onwards within the 1.21 series
- It will NOT work with 1.20.x or 1.22.x (if/when released)

## Technical Details

### Build Configuration
- **Base Version**: 1.21.1 (for compatibility)
- **Yarn Mappings**: 1.21.1+build.3
- **Fabric Loader**: 0.16.0+
- **Fabric API**: 0.102.0+1.21.1 (or any 1.21.x compatible version)

### Version String Format
The mod declares: `"minecraft": "~1.21"`

This uses Fabric's version range syntax:
- `~1.21` = 1.21.x (any patch version)
- `>=1.21` = 1.21 and above (including 1.22+)
- `1.21.1` = exactly 1.21.1

## Testing Compatibility

The mod has been built against Minecraft 1.21.1 which provides maximum compatibility with:
- Earlier 1.21.x versions (forward compatible)
- Later 1.21.x versions (backward compatible)

## Future Minecraft Versions

### For 1.21.x updates
The mod should work without recompilation for future 1.21.x releases.

### For 1.22+ (when released)
A new version of the mod will need to be built with:
- Updated `minecraft_version` in gradle.properties
- Updated `yarn_mappings` for the new version
- Potentially updated `fabric_version` for the new Minecraft version
- Update version constraint to `~1.22` or `>=1.21`

## Fabric API Compatibility

The mod declares `"fabric-api": "*"` which means:
- Any version of Fabric API is accepted
- Users should install the Fabric API version matching their Minecraft version
- For 1.21.1 → Use Fabric API 0.102.0+1.21.1 or compatible
- For 1.21.4 → Use Fabric API 0.110.0+1.21.4 or compatible

## Loader Version

**Minimum**: Fabric Loader 0.16.0
**Recommended**: Latest Fabric Loader for your Minecraft version

## Java Version

**Minimum**: Java 21
**Recommended**: Java 21 or Java 22

Minecraft 1.21+ requires Java 21, so this mod follows the same requirement.

1. Install Fabric Loader 0.16.0+
